## Github graphql reader + React + Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How to install? 
`npm install`
 
### Github personal key is necessary! 
Create a .env file in the root folder of this project with the `REACT_APP_REACT_APP_GITHUBKEY` variable with your key. This is mandatory to make requests to github graphql api.

### ES6 Features

- Desconstruction assigment, To get objects and arrays into new variables in a more readable way.
- Classes, React uses ES6 classes to implement components.
- String search, I used it instead of indexOf in the commits filter.
